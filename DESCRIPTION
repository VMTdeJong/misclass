Description: Adjust for misclassification of an exposure variable in pooled data,
  such as in an individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA). Using Bayesian
  misclassification models, the potential misclassification of an exposure is
  accounted for, and the uncertainty is propagated to the variance and CI. 
  Modeling of an single data set (without clustering) is also possible.
  The misclassification model is fitted using misclass(). This package is 
  intended to make using a misclassification model easier. Therefore, it is not 
  entirely comprehensive, but it is designed to be flexible. The functions
  make.inits(), make.model() and make.monitors() can be used separately to 
  tweak the model, but are otherwise called by misclass().
